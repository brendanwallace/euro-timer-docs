# Privacy Policy for the EuroTimer Mobile Application

This privacy policy governs your use of the software application EuroTimer (henceforth the Application) which was created by Brendan Wallace. The Application is a simple, minimal multi-person game timer.

## What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?

The Application collects almost no information from you, the user.

The Application collects your name and the names of any other users when you enter them in the 'edit players' page. This information is only stored locally on your phone, and is never uploaded to a server by the author of the Application. (It may be uploaded as part of your own actions to back up data on your phone).

This information is used to display your name and the names of the other users of the Application to you and the other users while you're using it.

## Is my information saved anywhere?

Besides any potential uploaded backups of your phone's data and locally on the phone itself, no. What little information the Application ever collects is not saved anywhere else.

## What about third parties?

No third parties will have access to any of your data through your usage of the Application.

## How is data retained, and how can I delete it?

Data is only retained within the Application's storage locally on your phone. If you uninstall the Application and delete its local storage, you will have completely removed all of your data (except any backups you yourself made of the Application).
